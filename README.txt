My program should be run under the "CalculatorView.java" class which is where I have my main function. 

You should run the program with the argument simpleAccountInput.txt

For all of the text fields:
	you will type the number or string inside the text field and press ENTER. 
	If you do not press enter then the actionListener did not hear anything.
